# MJT2026
## This repository contains my solutions, exercises, and assignments completed as part of the Modern Java Technologies course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University, led by Dr. Stoyan Vellev.

The course focuses on applying modern Java concepts such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Clean Code and Collections
- Generics and Unit Testing
- File I/O and Stream API
- Multithreading and Networking
- REST, HTTP, and JSON
- Design Patterns

The goal of this repository is to document my progress in advanced Java development and showcase practical implementations of key concepts used in modern software engineering.
